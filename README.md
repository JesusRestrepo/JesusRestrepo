- 👋 Hi, I’m @JesusRestrepo
- 👀 I’m interested in continue learning many more things about this world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about full-stack development, in Front End i have knowledge in React.js, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS3, in Back End i have
knowledge in python, node.js and .net core with c#. In Batabases like MySQL, SQL server. Actually, i am acquiring knowledge in ABAP, and BSP applications. Also i have knowledge in bots, through Python, and webscraping with python Selenium.
- I’m looking to collaborate on what I can, I am a person with a good disposition, but I would be much
more interested in being able to collaborate in all the part of web application development
